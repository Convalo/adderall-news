        <h2><strong>TAKING THE HABIT WITH YOU</strong></h2>
<p>Adderall news finds that nearly 20% of college students within the U.S. are addicted to <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/adderall-uses-abuses">Adderall</a>. What&rsquo;s worse is the addiction follows these students after their graduation and introduction into the work world, where it continues.</p>
<p>Adderall, known for its amphetamine properties, which combats ADHD as well as narcolepsy, is also recognized <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/kid-off-college-time-chat">on college campuses</a> and the work environment as the &ldquo;study drug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most students understand that their use of Adderall in college is strictly for study purposes. But little do they know that breaking the Adderall habit isn&rsquo;t so easy â€“ that in most cases it takes professional help to detox and recover from the highly addictive nature of Adderall.</p>
<p>With that said, these students have gone on to graduate, but unlike shedding their cap and gowns, they have been unable to shake their Adderall habit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>WHO ARE THESE STUDENTS THAT CONTINUE THEIR HABITS POST GRADUATION?</strong></h2>
<p>Many of the college students who used or currently use Adderall as a study aid, hail from the Millennial generation. The Millennials are a generation for whom taking prescription drugs can be as common as kids from earlier generations who smoked cigarettes and drank coffee to help themselves through school.</p>
<p>Of course with cigarettes now being stigmatized, as well as cigarette smoking being a habit that has long since decreased in popularity, Adderall has taken over as the workplace drug that enables better concentration and enhances job performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>READ THE LABEL</strong></h2>
<p>For a long time now, Adderall has been deemed to be a highly addictive and dangerous drug. Because of Adderall&rsquo;s addictive nature, the drug has been rated as a Schedule II controlled substance.</p>
<p>But to the recent graduate who has moved onto a <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/drug-testing-employers-look">professional career</a>, Adderall is a necessary part of the 9-to-5 grind; as necessary as a good pen or an attractive tie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is looking into this relatively new trend, however: A recent study of 11 million U.S. workers found that workplace drug tests are coming back positive at the highest rates in a decade, and they&rsquo;re continuing to increase. </p>
<p>In short, amphetamines, including Ritalin and Adderall, were shown to be the second most common&nbsp;drugs detected in workplace drug tests, only after marijuana.</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of adults with prescriptions for ADHD medication is far past 5 million, with prescriptions for those 26 to 34 as the driving force.</p>
<h2><strong>THE ADDICTION AND THE PAYMENT</strong></h2>
<p>We know that Adderall is highly addictive, even as it continues to be actively prescribed to both adults and children. And with no real program in place other than rehab to help a person eliminate their day-to-day Adderall use, these individuals stay on the drug for very lengthy periods of time. </p>
<p>Known side effects of long-term Adderall use are insomnia, increased blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, appetite suppression, headaches, dry mouth, and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting ahead in school and after one graduates, succeeding in the working world, is why we try to do our best in both college and on the job. But when it comes to stimulants like Adderall to give us that extra edge, maybe in the short run one might find there&rsquo;s value in the drug. Yet, in the long run, that value can diminish quickly to the point of there being literally zero returns.</p>
